> **Documents [`GL-DPPD-[LFQ-MBR].md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-[LFQ-MBR]_Versions/GL-DPPD-[LFQ-MBR].md), [`GL-DPPD-[TMT10].md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-[TMT10]_Versions/GL-DPPD-[TMT10].md), [`GL-DPPD-[TMT16].md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-[TMT16]_Versions/GL-DPPD-[TMT16].md), and [`GL-DPPD-[TMT16-phospho].md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-[TMT16-phospho]_Versions/GL-DPPD-[TMT16-phospho].md) contain overview and example commands for how GeneLab processes Proteomics datasets using the LFQ-MBR, TMT10, TMT16, and TMT16-phospho workflows, respectively. See the [Repository Links](#repository-links) descriptions below for more information. Processed data output files and a GeneLab data processing summary is provided for each GLDS dataset in the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/).**
