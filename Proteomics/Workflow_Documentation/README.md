# GeneLab Proteomics Workflow Information

> **GeneLab has wrapped each step of the pipeline into a workflow with validation and verification of output files built in after each step. The table below lists (and links to) each Proteomics pipeline version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current Proteomics pipeline/workflow implementation is indicated. Each workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow version and run info process specific datasets that have been released are available in the \*nextflow_processing_info.txt file on the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/), which can be found under 'Files' -> 'GeneLab Processed Proteomics Files' -> 'Supplemental Materials'.**
